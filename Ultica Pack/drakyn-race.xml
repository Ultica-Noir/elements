        <description>
			<p class="flavor">Born of dragons and humans, drakyn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, drakyn born from dragons as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some Drakyn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</p>
			<h4>Physical Description</h4>
			<p>Drakyn is the direct result of a full Dragon and Humanoid offspring. This usually happens when a Dragon mates with a human when shape-shifted, sometimes done for love, lust or other reasons. However, regardless of the reason, these offspring are often easily identified by their physical characteristics being such a blatant mix of Human and Dragon features. They boast strong and muscular physiques, towering over most humans with their impressive height and looking down at them with their dragon-shaped eyes. The face and body itself are usually that of a humanoid accented with various draconic features and scales. Though they are not as common as Dragonborn, some exhibit other draconic features such as having a tail, wings, and even horns due to the varied and unique circumstances of each of their heritage birth they generally can be categorized into their different subraces depending on their full draconic parents color.</p>
			<h4>History</h4>
			<p>Dragons have been around a long time and with the rise of man dragons had to get around without being noticed and so they roamed the world in a human form. Often during their adventures or exploits they've taken out of curiosity, they would meet someone who would catch their eye and then their heart. The alignment and circumstances of the dragon parent would shape how that relationship was and whether they would take the child themselves, have the human keep it or if it was simply abandoned by both.</p>
			<h4>Society</h4>
			<p>Drakyn being so few in number don't have their own society but are something like half-elves in both of their parent's societies. Quite often the type of dragon will determine what happens to the child. Most male dragons rarely wait around for the child to be born and often never see them, however, some of the more noble dragons, notably Gold and Silver, will often stay and teach the child the ways of their people.</p>
			<p>Female dragons may or may not stay with the father. However, when it is time to lay eggs, she leaves to a secluded spot that fits her nature for a time. A female dragon lays egg different from the rest of the clutch, however, sometimes twin eggs are born. The Drakyn then grows in the egg until the age of 2 and then hatches. During this growing time, the mother speaks to and teaches the child telepathically. They are born knowing how to walk and speak and usually have much larger wings, scales, horns, and tail than those born from human mothers. Some then return with the child to where they lived, while others will stay where were born, or move on. The child usually stays with the mother until young adulthood. All Drakyn born from a humanoid mother retain genetic memories from the father (Life lessons, certain memories, etc).</p>

			<p>You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.</p>
