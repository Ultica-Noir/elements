		<description>
            <p>An elf sits alone at the top of a cliff overlooking a small town. He keeps an eye on the movement if those below as he devotes the rest of his attention to sharpening and fletching arrows. A flash of light catches his eye. The signal. The elf picks up his spyglass to find the target. He catches sight of the dishevelled human stumbling from a worn barn. </p>
            <p>As the elf starts to nock an arrow a soft, blue light begins to suffuse his eyes and arms. Slowly, the glow spreads to the arrow, all while the elf keeps the human in his sights. As the light reaches the tip of the arrow, he breathes out and releases his fingers. </p>
            <p>The arrow fires so powerfully from the bow that the elf hears the sound moments after he's shot it. It tears through the air as it charges toward its target, near unseen in its speed. The human walks several steps before he realizes there is a hole in his chest. As he falls to the ground with a wordless gurgle, the elf nocks another arrow and waits, eyes on the barn door. </p>
            <h4>Ki: Magic Refined</h4>
            <p>A Cultivator will learn early in their training that ki is created when they condense the arcane energies that make up the magic in the world around them. It can be absorbed into the body and refined in one's core, which normally resides just above the navel. </p>
            <p>Breathing techniques are used to refine ki, and there are as many breathing techniques as actual techniques. Regardless of how it's gathered, ki is the driving force behine a Cultivator's power. It is used to augment their bodies and the world around them much like magic. This energy has birthed a multitude of techniques that Cultivators use to prove themselves</p>
            <p>However, a true Cultivator is someone who not only uses ki, but becomes it. This is the true goal of all those who follow this path.</p>
            <h4>Devoted Bodies. Devoted Minds.</h4>
            <p>A Cultivator will spend their entire life, often resolving to die training or fighting, focusing on their abilities. They will dedicate themselves to a single technique, spending their time improving it and making it their own. They train by fighting and constantly looking for the moment inspiration hits, driving their techniques to new limits.</p>
            <p>A Cultivator must have a strong body to handle the stress that training and ki cycling puts on it. They must also have a mind just as strong to learn, improve, and apply what combat teaches.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>

			<p>At the 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
			<h5>ARCHERY</h5>
			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
			<h5>DEFENSE</h5>
			<p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
			<h5>DUELING</h5>
			<p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
			<h5>GREAT WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
			<p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the twohanded or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>			
			<h5>PROTECTION</h5>
			<p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p>
            <h5>TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
			<p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
            <h5>UNARMED FIGHTING</h5>
            <p>Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8. When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a meelee attack.</p>

			<p>Starting at 15th level, you've become a spellcaster's bane. As a reaction, when an enemy within your weapon's range casts a spell, you may make a ranged attack roll against them. This attack cannot be made at advantage. If the attack hits, you do no damage, but the enemy must make a concentration save as if it were concentrating on a spell with a DC equal to your cultivator save DC. On a fail, the spell fails, and the slot is wasted. You may do this twice per long rest.</p>

			<p>Starting at 3rd level, your technique allows you to access to knowledge on how to use ki internally for defensive abilites and externally for offensive ones.</p>
            <p>You can choose the external or internal stance before you roll for inititave. Switching between stances is a bonus action. Unless otherwise noted, you can only use the abilites and benefits granted by each stance while you are in it. Most stances have static passives that are active while in that stance and activated abilites.</p>
            <p>You are unable to use stances while you are incapacitated. If you are incapacitated while in a stance, you may regain either stance as a bonus action.</p>
