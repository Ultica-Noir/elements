		<description>
            <p>A dying man wanders the streets, looking for any help he can, and comes across a small shack with an old man inside. The man stumbles in with his fading vision and begs for help of the stranger, and right before he falls unconscious he sees the old figure pull out some needles and string, and with a strong yet soothing voice say, "Do not worry, I'm a Doctor", before his vision finally goes dark.</p>
            <p>A great red dragon roars at the group of adventurers, attempting to steal its horde instilling fear in their hearts. Except one immediately runs at the dragon and with a quick look shouts out its weakness, with a quick stab breaking off it's scales creating an opening for its allies to use.</p>
            <p>Through the clanging of metal and the splatter of blood on a harsh battlefield, a singular figure calmly walks through it. It walks wearing a dark mask with dark bottles in its hands. Each of the steps bringing dark miasma with him, with foes around it immediately falling to their knees, coughing up blood, and screaming in terror.</p>
            <p>Physicians may come in various forms, but one thing they all have in common is their understanding of life. Both of how to save it and make it blossom, as well as how to unmake it and make it crumble onto itself, slowly but inevitably through their great understanding.</p>
            <h4>THE MAN IN A WORLD OF MAGIC</h4>
            <p>In a world of magic, filled with followers of gods and mages capable of bending the very fabric of reality, the physician is a humble existence. While magic can heal wounds with a snap, not everyone is blessed with such power and talent, or even the ability to try. Because of that, many take up books to still try and understand medicine and how to save lives. While creatures of magic can heal without fully understanding what they are doing, physicians pride themselves on their knowledge, which allows them to fix things that even magic couldn't, and with great precision at that.</p>
            <h4>TRUE UNDERSTANDING</h4>
            <p>All physicians seek to study and comprehend the world with all of its intricacies, hoping to prove the might of every person and the power a mere man can possess, with the might of knowledge and understanding, wielding it as their eternal weapon and shield.</p>
            <h4>NEVER ENDING STUDY</h4>
            <p>A physicians journey to true understanding is a long one, often through many trials and tribulations. To understand all creatures, how life truly works and the very nature of the world, is a destination with no certain path, so many take different roads. Some study it in battle, through dissecting their opponents and understanding what makes them act the way they do, while others sit in studies researching herbs and reading theory, to try and comprehend the laws of the world. But few in the end see the peak of the path. Those that do, become creatures of myth, who very often are even misunderstood as miracle workers and creatures of magic themselves, without even doing a singular bit of magic. All through the simple, unchanging power of science.</p>

The DC for the Wisdom (Medicine) check is 10, plus 2 for each First Aid Die you chose when beginning the attempt. On a success, roll the First Aid Dice and the target creature heals that many hit points plus your Physician level. On a failure, they regain half the number of hit points.

			<p>While many physicians study the body and the natural world to fix it and save as many people as possible, some look at it through more diabolic lenses. Toxicologists study nature and the living to create various poisons and substance to break down the living tissue in the most efficient and calculated ways possible. Many of them end up as suppliers to assassins guild, some serve in armies as alchemists, poisons and spreading plagues in the fields, while others learn how to make toxins, to try and stop others from using the same methods. In the end, all of them are specialists in ending lives be it first hand, or second.</p>

            <p>At 3rd Level, you have developed an adaptive poisonous substance that you can envelop your weapons in, allowing you to slowly, but surely break down your opponents bodies, until their own bodies fail them. When you make a weapon attack, you may use this ability. On a hit, choose either Strength, Dexterity or Constitution and afterwards make an Wisdom (Medicine) check, trying to beat the Ability Score chosen for the opponent A caustic creature is afflicted by all negatives of it's stage and ones below according, to the Caustic Stage Table (which can be seen at the end of the class). Additionally at the end of its turn, roll a number of dice equal to the caustic stage and it takes the amount of damage equal to the result (for example at level three, at viral stage 1, the creatured takes 1d4 poison damage). At the end of each if its turns, it may roll a saving throw with the previously chosen Ability Score (If you target Constitution, the target makes a Constitution saving throw) against your Caustic Save DC reducing Caustic to stage 0 on a success. On a failure, the poison continues coursing through the creature and grows in intensity, increasing it's stage by 1, up to a maximum of your proficiency modifier. The creature may repeat this saving at the end of each of it's turns. If the caustic creature gets hit by Caustic Strike again, it's Caustic increases by 1 stage, no check required. Caustic damage die at 3rd level is a d4 and increases to a d6 when you reach 5th level, d8 at 11th level and d10 at 17th level.</p>
            <p>If the result of the Wisdom (Medicine) check is higher by 5 or more than needed to succeed, the creature begins at a stage equal to half your proficiency modifier rounded up.</p>
            <p>Caustic Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

When a caustic creature dies, the toxin inside it begins spreading and all creatures within 10 feet of it must make a saving throw of your choice (that you could choose with Caustic Strike). On a failure, they become caustic as if affected by Caustic Strike.</p>

You become immune to poison damage as well as the poisoned condition. Additionally, now as an action you may spread the caustic toxin around you in a 10 feet radius for the next 1 minute. When a hostile creature first enters the area or starts its turn there, it must make a saving throw of your choice (that you could choose with Caustic Strike) and on a failure they become caustic. When a caustic creatures starts its turn in the area, it must repeat the same saving throw and on a failure the creatures caustic stage increases by 1 stage.
