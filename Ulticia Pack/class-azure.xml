		<description>
            <p>Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, even when it's done so much better. An azure cloaked elven woman strides toward two massive white and red dragons in the arena, her lance at the ready, her form crackling with energy, with each step turning the floor into ash. She lunges at the fierce monsters with eyes aflame and powerful magic coating her. Shouts, cheers, and curses echo within the underground arena.</p>
            <p>A confident smirk spreads across the face of the veteran mage, when the white dragon, without hesistation, engulfs her in a sea of freezing breath. The ice biting with raw intensity, She grits her teeth and ignores the pain. Unleashing the spell brewing within. Untold knowledge pours into her, reverberating through her body, as the icey breath finally ceases.</p>
            <p>With lightning quick steps, streaking towards the white dragon, she makes her move. With one powerful cut she beheads the mighty dragon. Sprays of blue blood marking her, as the massive head crashes beside her. All grows silent around her, stunned. Her remaining quarry, the red dragon, too is shocked for the briefest of moments, but that was the moment, the only moment she needed.</p>
            <p>She inhales deeply, her lungs filling with air that grows colder and colder with each passing moment. The azure woman, drenched in ice cold blood, exhales. From which the self same sea of cold icey breath bursts forth from out her lungs, engulfing the wrym. A frozen solid statue stands before her, of a once great red dragon.</p>
            <h3>AZURE CASTERS</h3>
            <p>Some tales of the hostile distant lands speak of monstrous magic and daring adventures of mages clothed in blue. These adventurers are known as The Azure: They travel the plane, studying and researching the magic of monsters and mimicry</p>
            <h3>VANGUARDS OF BLUE MAGIC</h3>
            <p>The discovery of what is referred to as blue magic stems from endless possibilty. Harnessing a new frontier of magical capabilitiies, it proceeds to steal and mimic things that were once just natural abilities. Mimicries, as they are called, blend wielder and a sliver of monsters for just a moment to replicate their destructive abilities. With experience and knowledge, an Azure can exceed their limits to untold reaches, into the realm of what was thought to be solely for monsters.</p>
            <h3>CREATING AN AZURE</h3>
            <p>When creating an Azure, you must consider what lead to your discovery of mimicry and magic. Was it accidental, or fervent passion and dream? Or did you learn it from a wise sage or a ridiculed academic?</p>
            <p>As well as why are you pursuing this new form of magic. Is it to test and know the limits of this unknown souce of magic, or is to pursue other personal goals. Whatever it be, you wield unknowability, so cherish and forsake the possibilities.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an Azure quickly by using these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by your Constitution. Second, take the sage background.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to magically learn and mimic monster abilities and spells.</p>
            <p>When you or a friendly creature are the target of a spell or a learnable monster ability/trait, you may use your reaction to make an Intelligence ability check to learn it. You roll with disadvantage if you were not hit by or the target of the spell or monster ability. </p>
            <center>
            <p><strong>Learn DC</strong> = 10 + half the target's CR or Spell Level (whichever is higher).</p>
            </center>
            <p>On a success, the monster ability/trait is magically added to your grimoire of mimicry in a basic form but can not be prepared until it has been copied down. If it was a spell that was learned, it will be added to your spells copied if there are any empty slots, or to replace another. Any spell thats not committed to memory is lost after a short or long rest. You may use this feature on friendly creatures to learn spells but not abilities/traits.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, you can learn monster abilities of a higher level than you can cast. If the ability does damage its is reduced to the amount stated in the Mimicry Guidelines table deatiled at the end of this class.</p>
            <p>Starting at 7th level, spells you have copied before no longer require a roll to relearn.</p>
            <h5>Azure Learning 101</h5>
            <p>If a spell or monster ability inflicted a condition (such as unconscious, petrified, charmed, etc.), and you are able to recover from said condition, you will do so having learned the spell or monster ability if you succeeded the learning attempt</p>
        </description>
        <sheet action="Reaction">
            <description>When you or a friendly creature are the target of a spell or learnable monster ability/trait you may make an Intelligence check to learn it. You roll at advantage if your were not the target of the spell or ability. The DC is 10 + half the creature's CR or Spell Level (take highest). On a success it is added to your grimoire. Any spells not added to your Spells Copied is forgotten after 1 minute.</description>

        <description>
            <p>Your arcane studies and pursuits have shown you a revolutionary way of casting magic.</p>
            <h5>Spells Copied</h5>
            <p>At 1st level, you know one 1st-level spell of your choice from any spell list and one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list.</p>
            <p>The Spells Copied column of the Azure table shows when you can copy more spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you copy must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 11th level, for example, you copy a new Azure spell, that spell can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level and can be added or replaced up to your Spells Copied Limit. Spells that are learned through the Learn feature can be from any spell list.</p>
            <p>You do not gain spells to copy when you gain a level in this class. Furthermore, any spells that are replaced are immediately forgotten.</p>
            <h5>Spell Slots</h5>
            <p>The Azure table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Azure spells. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your Azure spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. </p>
            <p>You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
            <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Azure, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell or mimicry refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Azure spell, mimicry, or Azure feature you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			</center>
            <h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>
            <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Azure spells.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You have started to grasp the fundamentals of mimicry.</p>
            <h5>Grimoire of Mimicry</h5>
            <p>At 1st level, you have a Grimoire of Mimicry containing three mimicries, Mephit Breath (Magma), Sting (Pseudodragon), and Web Sense. Your Grimoire of Mimicry is the repository of monster abilities/traits you know.</p>
            <p><strong>Copying a Monster Ability into the Grimoire.</strong>When you learn a new monster ability, you can finish adding it to your grimoire of mimicry if you can spare the time to analyze and fully record it during a long rest.</p>
            <p>For each CR higher than your class level, the process takes 2 hours and costs 60 gp, otherwise the process takes 1 hour and 30 gp. The hours spent copying does not need to be done consecutively, needing only a total amount of time spent. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the monster ability just like your other mimicries. </p>
            <p>Monster ability recharge rates are removed and any daily use amounts are left unchanged. Furthermore, damage dice/effects are replaced based on their CR. More information about this can be found in the Mimicry Guidelines at the end of the class description.</p>
            <p><strong>Replacing the Grimoire.</strong>You can copy a mimicry from your own grimoire of mimicry into another grimoire - for example, to make a backup copy of your grimoire. This is like copying a new monster ability into your grimoire, but faster and easier. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied mimicry.</p>
            <p>If you lose your grimoire of mimicry, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the mimicries that you have prepared into a new grimoire of mimicry. Filling out the remainder of your grimoire of mimicry requires you to find new monster abilities/traits to do so, as normal.</p>
            <h5>Mimicries Prepared</h5>
            <p>You prepare the list of Azure mimicries that are available for you to cast. When you do so, choose a number of mimicries equal to your double your Constitution modifier + half your Azure level, rounded down (minimum of one)</p>
            <p>You can change your list of prepared mimicries when you finish a long rest. </p>
            <h5>Mimicry Slots</h5>
            <p>You can mimic and manifest monster abilities with your body and magic as a conduit. To do so, you use the required action, bonus action, or reaction that is needed to mimic said mimicry. If a monster ability does not state a required action, such as a Balor's Fire Aura or any other trait, then an action or reaction is required to activate it. </p>
            <p><strong>Trait Duration</strong> If a trait offers: Damage, Damage Reduction, Healing, or advantage on attacks or saving throws, then its duration is 1 minute and requires concentration. If a trait offers none of those, then the duration is 10 minutes and does not require concentration. You can dismiss a mimicry at any time (no action required).</p>
            <p><strong>Casting a Mimicry</strong>Whenever a mimicry you cast asks you to make an attack or use a DC, refer to your spellcasting ability. After a mimicry is cast, it needs to be recharged before it can be used again. At the beginning of your turn, roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, you regain the ability to cast that mimicry. </p>
            <p>All mimicries require verbal and somatic components to cast.</p>
            <p>The Azure table shows how many mimicries can be cast. You regain all expended mimicry slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

            <description>Whenever you successfully use counterspell, you may immediately redirect and cast the target spell as part of the same reaction. Spells can only be cast in this way if they are no higher than 7th level and have a casting time of either: an action, bonus action, or reaction. This spell uses your spellcasting ability, and acts as if you had cast it normally, regardless of your available spell slots and level. A new target or area must be chosen for the spell to resolve. </description>

			<p>Blue energy and smoke starts gathering violently in your hand until it starts fracturing and collapsing onto itself. Once it's near uncontrollable, you let loose your magic and make a ranged spell attack at the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 force damage and the next attack roll against the target has advantage. The surrounding area is littered with smoking blue shards</p>
			<p class="indent">The force damage dealt by this spell increases when you reach 5th level (2d6). Another flare manifests that can be thrown at 11th level dealing (1d6) and then (2d6) at 17th level. You can throw the flares at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each.</p>
