		<description>
            <p>The chanting grows louder and louder as another orcish zealot approaches the master. A robed man with an eldritch eye growing out of his forehead approaches the supplicant with a crazed grin spread across his face. With a mere wave of his hand, he contorts the zealot's flesh, breaking and mending bones and muscle until large, deformed wings sprout from the orc's back, followed by a cacophony of monstrous howls and bloodcurdling screams of bestial joy.</p>
            <p>A young beggar girl in tattered clothes sits between two gravestones. The other children aren't allowed to play with her, their parents say she's cursed or mad. She's not angry, they just don't understand, they can't hear the whispers like she does. But that's okay, one day they will whisper to her too and then they can all play together forever and ever.</p>
            <p>A human dressed in fancy but worn-down traveling clothes sits beaten behind a tree, counting his ragged breaths and listening for his pursuers. Just a minute more is all he needs, though even such a meager wish is not granted as dark figures emerge from the forest around him. "You couldn't possibly hope you'll outrun us, mister fancy hat. You alone against half of the assassin guild, you never stood a chance". The wounded man thanks the gods for the villain's tendency to gloat as he focuses the last bits of energy he needed and slams his staff against the ground. "No", he replies, as a huge monster with skin like magma manifests next to him out of thin air. "Never alone." </p>
            <p class="indent">Brilliant, often eccentric, but unquestionably powerful, summoners are masters of the physical realm. They manipulate the underlying magic of reality itself to change the world around them, or even create matter from nothing.</p>
            <h4>BREAKING POINT</h4>
            <p>As powerful and tempting as the abilties of the summoner are, rarely does anyone embark on that path willingly. The most fundamental skill of a summoner is being able to percieve the unseen magical structure of everything around them and then being smart enough to figure out how to change that structure to suit their needs. However, such fantastic insight rarely reveals itself to an ordinary person, and most summoners experience this revelation after a traumatic, life-changing event that undermines their very perception of reality.</p>
            <h4>CALL OF CREATION</h4>
            <p>Those that push through these hard times however, and show both wit and determination to master the knowledge they gained become full fledged summoners that follow what they describe as "callings". Every summoner interprets it in their own way, from personal philosophy to the will of the universe itself, but what doesn't change is that dedication to the calling allows each summoner to learn secrets and abilities unavailable to those without enough dedication.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a summoner quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score. Second, choose the scholar background.</p>
            <h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
            <p>As a summoner, you gain the following class features:</p>

            </ul>
            <h5>PROFICIENCIES</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled mb">

		<description>
			<p>The magic around you is mere clay and you are the sculptor.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the summoner spell list. You learn additional summoner cantrip of your choice at 4th and 10th level, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Summoner table.</p>
			<h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
			<p>The Summoner table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your summoner spells. To cast one of your summoner spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You prepare the list of summoner spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the summoner spell list. When you do so, choose a number of summoner spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your sumoner level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level summoner, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of summoner spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your summoner spells, since your magic relies on understanding the fundamental arcane structure of the universe. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a summoner spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
			<p>You can cast a summoner spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

	<element name="Essence Stone" type="Class Feature" source="Chthonic Legacy" id="ID_UN_CL_CLASS_FEATURE_SUMMONER_ESSENCE_STONE">
		<description>
			<p>At 1st level, you learn to sculpt the magic around you into the form of an essence stone. You can use this feature twice and regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p>As an action you can invoke the stone to summon a creature to a point you can see within 20 feet of you. The space where you summon your creature must be sufficient to fit the summon, otherwise this feature fails. The following rules apply to the summon:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can only summon creatures of a certain creature type, which depends on the Summoner's Calling you have selected and is detailed in each calling's description.</li>
				<li>The summoned creature cannot possess any Legendary Actions, cannot be a unique adventure NPC, and it's CR cannot exceed a certain limit. That limit is dependent on your level and is detailed in the Summon CR column of the summoner class table.</li>
				<li>The summoned creature can take the form of any creature within your CR range and your Summoner's Calling type. It knows a number of mixed moves you may select equal to your proficency bonus from all applicable creatures. You may instead choose to default to the statblock of your summoned creature’s appearance.</li>
				<li>Your summon cannot use moves that do not fit it's appearance (e.g. A giant snake could not have claw based attacks as it has no arms or legs). Even if your summon has wings, their fly speed is 0ft until you are at least 6th level.</li>
				<li>At any given moment, you can only have one summoned creature. Upon usage of other summoning features or spells such as find familiar, your current summon is dismissed and that creature is regarded as your summon for the duration.</li>
				<li>You have full control over your summon in and out of combat and it will obey all your commands. You can telepathically speak to and command your summon as long as you can see it and it's on the same plane of existance as you, no action required. When not commanded, the creature will prioritize protecting both you and itself. </li>
				<li>In combat it takes its turn on your initiative, but right after your turn. It can use all of its actions.</li>
				<li>The summoned creature cannot be healed by any other means than your mend summon feature.</li>
				<li>The summon disappears after a number of hours equal to half your summoner level (rounded up), until it drops to 0 hit points, when you complete a short or long rest or if you fall unconcious. Alternatively, you can use your bonus action to dismiss your summon.</li>
			</ul>
			<center>
				<h5>Essence Stone Appearance</h5>
				<p>The essence stones have different appearances. Some summoners prefer material housing for their creatures e.g. small black stones or balls. Others attach their creatures to their bodies in the form of a tattoo.</p>
