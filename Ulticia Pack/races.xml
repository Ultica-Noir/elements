        <description>
			<p class="flavor">Born of dragons and humans, drakyn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, drakyn born from dragons as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some Drakyn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</p>
			<h4>Physical Description</h4>
			<p>Drakyn is the direct result of a full Dragon and Humanoid offspring. This usually happens when a Dragon mates with a human when shape-shifted, sometimes done for love, lust or other reasons. However, regardless of the reason, these offspring are often easily identified by their physical characteristics being such a blatant mix of Human and Dragon features. They boast strong and muscular physiques, towering over most humans with their impressive height and looking down at them with their dragon-shaped eyes. The face and body itself are usually that of a humanoid accented with various draconic features and scales. Though they are not as common as Dragonborn, some exhibit other draconic features such as having a tail, wings, and even horns due to the varied and unique circumstances of each of their heritage birth they generally can be categorized into their different subraces depending on their full draconic parents color.</p>
			<h4>History</h4>
			<p>Dragons have been around a long time and with the rise of man dragons had to get around without being noticed and so they roamed the world in a human form. Often during their adventures or exploits they've taken out of curiosity, they would meet someone who would catch their eye and then their heart. The alignment and circumstances of the dragon parent would shape how that relationship was and whether they would take the child themselves, have the human keep it or if it was simply abandoned by both.</p>
			<h4>Society</h4>
			<p>Drakyn being so few in number don't have their own society but are something like half-elves in both of their parent's societies. Quite often the type of dragon will determine what happens to the child. Most male dragons rarely wait around for the child to be born and often never see them, however, some of the more noble dragons, notably Gold and Silver, will often stay and teach the child the ways of their people.</p>
			<p>Female dragons may or may not stay with the father. However, when it is time to lay eggs, she leaves to a secluded spot that fits her nature for a time. A female dragon lays egg different from the rest of the clutch, however, sometimes twin eggs are born. The Drakyn then grows in the egg until the age of 2 and then hatches. During this growing time, the mother speaks to and teaches the child telepathically. They are born knowing how to walk and speak and usually have much larger wings, scales, horns, and tail than those born from human mothers. Some then return with the child to where they lived, while others will stay where were born, or move on. The child usually stays with the mother until young adulthood. All Drakyn born from a humanoid mother retain genetic memories from the father (Life lessons, certain memories, etc).</p>

		<description>
            <p class="flavor">Once, we were brothers. Those times have long since past, now, I am afraid. I still remember when we were but children, and we thought that your 'evil' red skin meant nothing. Omg period that's what we were back then, in the old days. Now, I send this letter to you, my brother, as my final act of kindness towards you; a warning. I will not rest, nor will our fellow kin, until you lay dead in the dirt.</p>
            
            <h4>FALLEN HEROS</h4>
            <p>Long ago, the realms of the dead and the realms of the living were close enough to clash day after day, corpses rising moments after they are killed, ghosts possessing the living, and wraiths ruling the land. From the shadows, the Akuma rose to bring balance to the realms. A force of neutrality ensuring both sides did not opress the other for too long. They have been hunted to near extinction as the humans developed as their horns were highly valued by collectors.</p>

            <h4>ON THE RUN</h4>
            <p>In many cultures after the fall of the Akuma, Akuma have been depicted as creatures of malice and destruction, laying waste to the land and people who surround them. While some Akuma attempt to go against this stereotype, they are still hated the same as the rest of their kin, forcing many Akuma to live an existence of constant running and travel. Many times, an Akuma may believe their only companions to be similarly hated creatures, such as orcs, half elfs, or other Akuma.</p>

            <h4>PRIDE OF THE HORNED</h4>
            <p>An Akuma's greatest symbol of pride are their horns, with each Akuma having their own unique pair. No two Akuma have horns that are exactly the same, even the closest of relatives will have tiny differences in their horns. Because of this even though they might be hunted and persecuted, Akuma will almost never willingly hide their horns as it would go against who they are and what defines them.</p>

            <h4>AKUMA NAMES</h4>
            <p>Akuma  are very close to their families, with many believing that all strangers only bring pain and suffering. They display their family's name before their own, to show their pride that their relatives bring them, as well as to intimidate those who have wronged their family before. The names that they take on all have meaning in their native tongue, Wuxian, usually relating to positive characteristics the parents wish for their child to take on.</p>
            <ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Male Akuma Names:</strong> Akihiko, Dai, Eiji, Hiro, Isamu, Jun, Katsuo, Kirito</li>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Cero Senko.</em></strong> In an act of desperation all Akuma have a final move as a last ditch effort. Akuma can charge a beam from their horns and shoot it out dealing 1d8 force damage for each hit die consumed.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, and Wuxian. Wuxian is a strange tongue, one that tends to ignore traits of other languages, such as writing words as symbols instead of letters.</p>
